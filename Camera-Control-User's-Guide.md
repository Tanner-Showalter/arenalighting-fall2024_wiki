# Camera Control
Camera control allows you to view the light show at the stadium from various perspectives such as particular sections, areas, top view, side view, etc. These are fixed positions and can be managed in the **fixed camera control** mode. In addition to that you view the show by moving around the stadium. There are predefined camera movements available in the **dynamic camera control** mode. Such moments include moving around the stadium (Aerial View), passing on the side, etc. If you would like to move around the stadium freely like from the drone there is a **free camera control** mode. I've shared more detailed information about each method below.

## Camera Control UI

The camera control user interface (UI) is at the top-left corner of the screen. It consists of two left-right switching boxes.
